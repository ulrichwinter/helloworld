# Testcontainers Helloworld Docker Image

This is a Docker image for use by Testcontainers' own self-test suites. It is not intended for use outside of the Testcontainers project.

It features a small HTTP server with the following characteristics:

* It serves content on two ports (8080 and 8081) to enable testing that multiple Docker container ports can be exposed.
* It serves an HTML root page, with a few basic elements, to enable verification that browser-based test tools can access the container.
* It serves a non-HTML endpoint at `/ping`, to enable plain HTTP testing.
* It serves a UUID unique to this running instance of the container, at `/uuid`, to enable testing of multiple container instances or testing of stop/start behaviour.
* It implements a configurable delay at startup before each port's server is started, to enable testing of startup wait strategies (TCP or HTTP-based). Setting the environment variable `DELAY_START_MSEC` to a non-zero number will:
    * wait for the defined duration
    * start the port 8080 server
    * wait again for the same duration
    * start the port 8081 server
* It emits a basic log message after starting which can be used to test log-based wait strategies.
* It serves a `/echo` endpoint, where alle header values are returned and an externally visible URI for this endpoint is constructed from the relevant proxy headers.
